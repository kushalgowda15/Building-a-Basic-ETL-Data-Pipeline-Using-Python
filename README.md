 ETL Pipeline, Data Analysis & VIP Customer Classification  

## 🎯 Objective  
This lab experiment provides practical experience in building a basic **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** data pipeline using Python. It demonstrates how raw sales and customer feedback data can be processed, analyzed, and used for machine learning tasks such as **VIP customer classification**.  

The project also simulates real-world collaboration between **Business Analysts, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, and ML Engineers** in the data lifecycle.  

---

## ✅ Outcomes  
- Identify and describe the stages of the **data engineering lifecycle**.  
- Explain the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders at each stage.  
- Perform basic ETL and data analysis tasks within a simulated environment.  
- Apply **machine learning (K-Means clustering)** to classify VIP customers.  
- Export enriched datasets (reverse ETL) for business use.

## ⚙️ Setup & Requirements  
Install dependencies:  
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

## 🔄 Workflow

---

### **Stage 1: Business Analyst Task**
- Reviewed raw datasets (`sale_price.csv`, `customer_feedback.json`).
- Defined business question:  
  **"What are the top 5 products by revenue in the last quarter, and how does customer sentiment vary for these products?"**

---

### **Stage 2: Data Engineer Task (ETL.py)**
1. **Extract** – Load raw sales & feedback data using Pandas.  
2. **Transform** –  
   - Clean missing values, fix data types, standardize dates.  
   - Calculate `total_revenue = sale_price × quantity`.  
   - Merge datasets on `product_id` & `customer_id`.  
3. **Load** – Export final dataset to:  
                                -data_warehouse/processed_sales_data.csv


---

### **Stage 3: Data Analyst Task (DA.py)**
- Aggregated data to find **Top 5 Products by Revenue**.  
- Calculated **Average Sentiment Score** for each product.  
- Generated visualizations:  

📊 **Top 5 Products by Revenue**  
📈 **Average Sentiment Score**  

---

### **Stage 4: Machine Learning Task (ML.py)**
- **Goal:** Classify customers into **VIP** vs **Non-VIP** using purchasing behavior.  
- **Steps:**  
1. Feature engineering → `total_purchase_amount`, `purchase_frequency`, `avg_transaction_value`.  
2. Normalize features with **MinMaxScaler**.  
3. Apply **K-Means clustering (k=2)**.  
4. Assign VIP label to cluster with higher total purchase.  
5. Perform **Reverse ETL** → Export enriched data with VIP status.  

---

## 📈 Final Results & Insights
- ✅ **Top 5 Products by Revenue** identified with corresponding **average sentiment**.  
- ✅ **Visualizations** created (Revenue bar chart, Sentiment line chart).  
- ✅ **VIP Customers** classified using clustering approach.  
- ✅ **Reverse ETL** exported enriched dataset for business use (targeted marketing, personalization).

## 📝 Conclusion
This lab successfully demonstrated how to build an **end-to-end data pipeline** with:  
- ETL for data preparation  
- Data Analysis for insights  
- Machine Learning for customer segmentation  
- Reverse ETL for operational use  

This workflow mirrors **real-world data engineering and analytics projects**, showcasing how raw data can be turned into actionable business insights.
